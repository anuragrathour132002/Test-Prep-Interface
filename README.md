# Design-a-Test-Prep-Interface

I'll be exhibiting my concept for a piece of AI-driven software that aids in exam preparation in this repository. I made an aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly, and straightforward interface using Figma.
I'll first take you step-by-step through the problem presentation. The design is simple and elegant. Next, I'll demonstrate the chat interface for the AI tutor. Users are able to communicate with the AI tutor and ask inquiries about the issue.
I've added a progress or point tracker to keep users engaged.
Finally, I'll describe how I made sure the design was responsive. I hope you find my design insightful and motivating because it makes use of Figma's responsive design characteristics. Don't forget to look at the design's PDF output on GitHub.
